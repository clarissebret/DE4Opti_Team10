# Cost optimisation of an electric skateboard
Clarisse Bret, Sergi Capdevila

The purpose of this project is to optimise the price of electric skateboards by focusing on the price of the deck and the wheels. The main barriers to price is safety in the shape of minimum load required to be supported. For the optimisation of both subsystems, fmincon and ga algorithmic models have been explored and applied. results are a deck with a cost of £18.8 and wheels with a cost of £0.54 each.
